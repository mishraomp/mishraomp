## Lead Enterprise Architect | Government Digital Transformation

I architect large-scale government systems where failure isn't an option. My role sits at the intersection of strategic planning and hands-on technical execution - because you can't design resilient systems without understanding how they're actually built.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Focus

**Platform Engineering & Cloud Native**
- Design multi-cloud architectures across AWS, Azure, and on-premise OpenShift clusters
- Build platform abstractions that let developers ship code without worrying about infrastructure

**Microservices & Distributed Systems**
- Architect event-driven systems using Event Streaming.
- Implement distributed tracing and observability stacks (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana)

**Data Architecture**
- Design data platforms with high concurrency
- Implement CQRS and event sourcing patterns for audit-critical systems
- Build real-time search capabilities with Elasticsearch clusters

**Security & Compliance**
- Design zero-trust architectures with OIDC/OAuth2 implementations
- Build secure CI/CD pipelines

**DevOps & Platform Automation**
- Design PR based workflows and deployments using GHA
- Build IaC frameworks with Terraform (AWS/Azure) and Helm charts(OpenShift)
- Implement progressive delivery strategies (feature flags)
- Create self-service developer platforms reducing deployment time

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

**Languages:** `Go` `TypeScript` `Java` `Python` `Bash`  
**Container & Orchestration:** `Kubernetes` `OpenShift` `Docker` `Helm`  
**Cloud & IaC:** `AWS` `Azure` `Terraform`  
**CI/CD:** `GitHub Actions` `ArgoCD`  
**Data:** `PostgreSQL` `MongoDB` `Redis` `Elasticsearch` `Nats`  
**Observability:** `Prometheus` `Grafana` `ELK Stack` `OpenTelemetry`

### üìä Architecture Principles I Live By

- **12-Factor Apps:** Every service follows these principles - no exceptions
- **Infrastructure as Code:** If it's not in Git, it doesn't exist
- **Observable by Default:** Every system ships with metrics, logs, and traces
- **API-First:** Every service exposes a well-documented, versioned API
- **Failure-Resilient:** Design for failure, because everything eventually breaks

### üöÄ Current Focus

- Implementing Cloud Native DevSecOps practices to accelerate government digital services
- Building AI/ML platforms for citizen service automation
- Creating sustainable architectures targeting reduction in cloud costs
